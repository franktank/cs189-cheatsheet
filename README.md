These cheat sheets include:

-   [The original notes](<https://github.com/sharma409/EECScheats>) by Rishi
    Sharma and Peter Gao (from which this repo is forked), with some modifications:
    -   Rearranged sections to form better grouping, add section titles
    -   Reworded/condensed some sections in light of better grouping
    -   Added some new content
-   **All** past T/F and multiple choice questions from the following semesters:
    -   Spring 2013 midterm & final
    -   Spring 2014 final
    -   Spring 2015 midterm
-   Important algorithmic problems from discussions
-   Additional notes ("minicards")
    -   The `no-minicards` version omits these, so you can have space to add your own notes.
